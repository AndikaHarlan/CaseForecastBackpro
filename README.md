# CaseForecastBackpro
Abstract: 
Changes in the number of cases of disease is very influential on health improvement efforts both in terms of medicines availability, 
targeted medicines, damaged medicines and so forth. Knowing the pattern of the number of cases of disease is very important for 
some activities and jobs that exist. Therefore it is necessary to forecast the number of cases of disease to determine the 
pattern of the number of cases of disease in the future. One of the most common method of artificial neural network forecasting is 
Backpropagation. This study aims to forecast the number of cases of disease by using the case study of puskesmas Rogotrunan, 
Lumajang using Backpropagation method. Backpropagation parameters tested are the amount of data (n), alpha (Î±), and  the number of 
iterations (epoch). Forecasting the number of disease on cases with test data from January to December of 2016 conducted using 
Backpropagation resulted in the value of MSE 115 and the accuracy of 0.0088.
